Here's a summary and analysis based on the KBBL dashboard provided:
### **Summary of the Dashboard:**
## ![KBBL Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb69e827-99a0-41ac-b860-d63760686668)
- **Total Sales Quantity:** 2,324,089 units
- **Total SAP Value:** 8,232,223.88
- **Number of Products:** 70
- **Number of Outlets:** 763
- **Top-performing products and outlets** are visualized through bar charts.
- **Distribution of Sales Volume by Quarter:** Shows a trend of sales over different quarters.
- **Percentage of Malt Group Sales:** A pie chart showing the distribution of sales by the Malt Group.
- **Highest Customer Purchases:** Bar chart indicating the top customers based on purchase volume.

### **1. Insights from the Primary Raw Data:**
1. **Top-Selling Products:** Certain products consistently outperform others, as indicated by the bar chart displaying sales by product.
2. **Sales Volume Trends:** There is a noticeable decline in sales volume over time, suggesting possible seasonality or other influencing factors.
3. **Outlet Performance:** A significant number of sales are concentrated in a few top outlets, indicating disparities in performance across outlets.

### **2. Insights from the Secondary Raw Data:**
1. **Quarterly Sales Fluctuations:** Sales volumes vary across quarters, with some quarters performing better than others, highlighting seasonality or external factors affecting sales.
2. **Malt Group Contribution:** The pie chart reveals that a large portion of sales comes from specific Malt Groups, with one group dominating the market.
3. **Top Customer Purchases:** A small group of customers accounts for a large share of total purchases, indicating a reliance on key accounts.

### **3. Correlation Between Primary and Secondary Insights:**
- **Sales Concentration:** Both data sets suggest that sales are concentrated in specific products, outlets, and customer groups, indicating a possible dependence on a limited range of factors.
- **Seasonality and Trends:** The decline in sales volume over time and quarterly fluctuations suggest a potential correlation, possibly driven by external factors like market demand or seasonality.

### **4. Advice to Management:**
1. **Diversify Product Portfolio:** Focus on boosting sales of lower-performing products to reduce dependency on top-selling items.
2. **Improve Outlet Performance:** Invest in training and support for underperforming outlets to increase overall sales volume.
3. **Customer Relationship Management:** Strengthen relationships with top customers while also expanding the customer base to reduce the risk of over-reliance on a few key accounts.
